This website is under active development.

I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the genomic bases of adaptation in fungi, with frequent ventures out into plant and bacterial systems. My research bridges the gap between two fundamental questions in biology: the "how did this happen?" of evolutionary biology, and the "how does this work?" of molecular biology.

I address these questions by integrating complementary techniques, ranging from molecular genetics to computational analyses to manipulative experiments. As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University under the supervision of [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed new phylogenetic-based algorithms for studying the evolution of fungal genome architecture in response to selection by plant secondary metabolites. Since graduating, I have been working as Postdoctoral Researcher with [Corlett Wolfe Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) at the University of Pennsylvania to investigate the evolutionary consequences of genetic constraints in plant root mutualisms. I will continue developing these research themes beginning in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints shape the evolution of fungal plant pathogens.

I am a firm believer in the emergent power of collaboration. To date, I have had the extremely good fortune of collaborating on diverse projects with many scientists and groups, including [Matthew T. Kasson](https://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/matthew-kasson) from the University of West Virginia, [Jonathan M. Jacobs](https://u.osu.edu/doctorjj/) from the Ohio State University and [Horacio D. Lopez-Nicora](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CV-mow8AAAAJ&hl=en) from the Universidad San Carlos.

I am committed to promoting public scientific literacy and fostering innovation within my own research community. To this end, I am serving as the Postdoc representative on the steering committee of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists. I helped co-organize our inaugural conference in July 2020, which had 63 speakers and 275 registrants from 89 institutions. You can access the conference program [here](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/uploads/2/3/5/6/23564534/canfunnet2020_schedule-final.pdf), and our white paper [here](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2020-0263#.XyBF0ShKiUk).
