This website is under active development, and is far from complete.

I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the genomic bases of adaptation in fungi, with frequent ventures out into plant and bacterial systems. My research is centered on three questions:

1)
2)
3)

I address these questions by integrating complementary techniques, ranging from molecular genetics to phylogenetics to manipulative experiments. As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Scholar at the Ohio State University, I developed new phylogenetic-based algorithms to identify genomic processes driving fungal adaptation to plant secondary metabolites during my Ph.D. with Jason C. Slot. As a Postdoctoral Researcher working with Corlett Wolfe Wood at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, I am currently generating transcriptomic datasets and implementing genome-wide association studies in order to investigate the evolutionary consequences of genetic constraints in plant root mutualisms. I will continue developing these research themes starting in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with Daniel Croll at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints on life histories shape the evolution of fungal plant pathogens.
