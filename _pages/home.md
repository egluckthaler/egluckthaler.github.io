I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the genomic bases of adaptation in fungi, with frequent forays into plant and bacterial systems. My research bridges the gap between two fundamental approaches to studying biological systems: the "how did this happen?" of evolutionary genetics, and the "how does this work?" of molecular genetics, in order to identify the processes most important for generating biological diversity.

I address these questions by integrating molecular, manipulative, and computational experiments. As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University under the supervision of [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed new phylogenetic-based algorithms for studying the evolution of fungal genome architecture in response to selection by plant defense compounds. Since graduating, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Corlett Wolfe Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to investigate the evolutionary consequences of genetic constraints in plant root mutualisms. I will continue developing these research themes beginning in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints together shape the evolution of fungal pathogens.

I am committed to promoting public scientific literacy and fostering innovation within my research community. To this end, I am serving as the Postdoc representative on the steering committee of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists. I helped co-organize our first conference in July 2020, which had 63 speakers and 275 registrants from 89 institutions, and am also co-organizing our next meeting on May 26-28, 2021, held in conjunction with the Great Lakes Mycological Meetings. You can access the CanFunNet white paper [here](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2020-0263#.XyBF0ShKiUk), the 2020 conference program [here](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/uploads/2/3/5/6/23564534/canfunnet2020_schedule-final.pdf), and apply to the upcoming 2021 conference here.
