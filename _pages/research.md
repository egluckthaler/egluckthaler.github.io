# Research

My overarching goal is to explore and understand the processes that accelerate or constrain fungal adaptation to their hosts and environments. 

# Causes and consequences of trade-offs



# Metabolic gene clusters and the architecture of resistance



# Adaptation in the absence of sex



# Genetics of neurochemical ecology



# Determinants of host tissue specificity
